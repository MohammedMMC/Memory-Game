# Memory Game

This is a fun and challenging Memory Sequence Game where your goal is to remember and repeat a sequence of flashing buttons. As you progress, the sequence gets longer and more difficult, testing your memory and concentration.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: The game begins when you click the middle button (highlighted in lime green). Once clicked, it will turn grey, and the game will start.

2. **Watch the Sequence**: A sequence of buttons will flash in a specific order. Pay close attention to the order and remember it.

3. **Repeat the Sequence**: After the sequence finishes, it's your turn to click the buttons in the same order as they flashed. 
   - If you get the sequence correct, the game adds another step to the sequence, and you need to remember a longer sequence.
   - If you make a mistake, the game ends.

4. **Earn Points**: Each time you correctly repeat the sequence, you earn a point. Try to see how many points you can accumulate by remembering longer sequences!

5. **Game Over**: The game ends when you click the wrong button. Your points will reset, and you can start a new game.
